Traps, Strings
==============

1) Construct an 'echo' that has a double-quoted string with a single-quoted string inside, eg one that outputs:

He said 'I thought she'd said "bash was easy when $s are involved" but that can’t be true!'

2) Research the other 'special' signal traps. Use `man bash` for this.

3) Write a shell script that you can’t escape from (the machine it runs on must not be overloaded as a result!) in the terminal.

4) Try and escape from the shell script you created in 1)

5) Ask everyone you know if they can escape the shell script

6) If no-one can escape it, send it to the author :)
