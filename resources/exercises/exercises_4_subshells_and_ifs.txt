Subshells and IFS
=================

1) Show that the group command (`{` and `}`) doesn't affect the outer shell's working directory, while a subshell (`(` and `)`)does.

2) Work out what the `BASH_SUBSHELL` variable does.

3) Find any files that have spaces in them from your '~' or $HOME folder. If you have none, create some and then find them with the find command.

4) Create a for loop that - for each file with a space in - adds a line with the filename to a file called 'spaces.txt'.
